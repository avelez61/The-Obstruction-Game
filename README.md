# The-Obstruction-Game
Obstruction is a 2 player pencil and paper game. Each player takes turns marking a cell on a grid. Once a cell is marked the surrounding cells are also marked as blocked. If all cells are marked the game is over and the player who cannot make a move loses. I programmed this game using Lua and the love2d framework.
